Character Generator
===================

This is the source repository for a character generator for Basic D&D
and Labyrinth Lord. In addition to that, it can be used to take any
SVG file (such as the character sheets in this directory) and fill in
parameters, essentially making it possible to "bookmark" a character
sheet. If you do this, you'll notice a little Link in the bottom right
of these character sheets. That's where you can edit your character.
Be sure to bookmark the new URL or you'll loose your edits!

The character generator is currently
[installed on Campaign Wiki](http://campaignwiki.org/halberdsnhelmets).
Take a look at the
[Help](http://campaignwiki.org/halberdsnhelmets/help) page. It comes
with links to examples of what this web application can do.

You can get the Purisa font for free from the
[linux.thai.net (LTN) Thai Linux FTP archive](ftp://linux.thai.net/pub/thailinux/software/thai-ttf/).
